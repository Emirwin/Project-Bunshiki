  - '"The process of how the verb changes form is called Conjugation"'
  - '"Japanese Verbs come in two types, Ichidan verbs and Godan verbs. They are grouped
    this way because they conjugate in different ways."'
  - '"Ichidan verbs end in ''ru'' and their conjugation often has them dropping ''ru''
    and adding a suffix. TABERU (to eat) becomes TABEMASU (to eat+polite suffix)."'
  - '"Godan verbs, on the other hand, end in ''u''. Their conjugation is more complicated.
    OSU (to push) can be made into its MASU form by dropping U and adding I, to make
    OSHIMASU."'
  - '"Not all verbs that end in ''ru'' are Ichidan verbs, though! Some are actually
    Godan. If you''re not sure, you can find out through the word panel."'
