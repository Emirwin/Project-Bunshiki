  - '"a-HA b-DESU is a simple pattern for a Japanese sentence. It means that ''a
    is b''"'
  - '"So the sentence ''WATASHI HA TAMAGO DESU'' literally translates to ''I am an
    egg''"'
  - '"DESU here functions as the ''is, are'' of the sentence while ''HA'' (pronounced
    wa) functions as the Topic Particle which means that the word before it is the
    topic of the sentence."'
